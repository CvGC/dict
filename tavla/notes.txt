Not limited to vocal speech, but this is implied by the x4 without context of some other medium of conversation (use cusku, casnu, skicu, ciksi for weaker implication of vocal communication); converse/discuss/chat (= {simta'a}, {simsku}, vricysimta'a for a conversation not clearly delimited by subject).  See also {bacru}, cusku for actual expression, {casnu}, {darlu}, {skicu}, {ciksi}, {bangu}.
