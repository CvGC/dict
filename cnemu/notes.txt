Differs from earned payment because of atypical nature; rewards need not be positive but are in some sense deserved from the point of view of the rewarder: positive reward (= {zanyne'u}), punishment, penalty, demerit (= {malne'u}, {sfane'u}); x4 may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posne'u}, posyvelne'u for unambiguous {semantics}).  See also {dunda}, {friti}, {jerna}, {jinga}, {jivna}, {pleji}, {sfasa}, {venfu}, {prali}, {dapma}.
