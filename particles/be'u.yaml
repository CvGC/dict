    Attitudinal modifier. Used to express lack of something.  When used as a
    modifier on another attitudinal, it indicates that the modified emotion is
    caused by or associated with a lack of something; it does not show a lack of
    the modified emotion. This word comprises a scale, along with "be'u cai" and
    "be'u nai".  See also "be'u cai" and "be'u nai" the preface.

      Many possible meanings, such as, "It's not here," "This is not enough." 
      (lacking something does not comment on sufficiency; I think "Something's
      missing" is closer.)
    .u'ibe'u: >-
      Surprisingly related/due to a lack of something," or perhaps, "Heh heh,
      not enough." (.u'i means amused, not surprised. I suggest one
      interpretation "Giddy from having nothing left to lose" instead.)
