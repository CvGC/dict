nu'o:
  word: nu'o
  class: CAhA
  pos: preposition
  definition: >-
    Tense marker used to express undemonstrated capability or unrealised
    potential.
  notes:
    - >-
      {nu'o} requires a capability to not be demonstrated/used/etc. even once.
      It is applicable in situations where {ka'e} is but {pu'i} is not.
  proposed tag:
    - Tense marker for undemonstrated capability.
  confer:
    - ka'e
    - pu'i
    - kakne
  keywords:
    - can but has not
    - is expected to be able to
  examples:
    .i mi nu'o se darxi fo lo stedu: 'I am capable of being, but have never been, struck on the head.'
  issues:
    - 'Not to be confused with {na''o}.'
    - >-
      There is also apparently little-to-no difference between {nu'o} and
      {na'epu'i}. Further investigation needed.
