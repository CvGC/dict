    A pro-sumti for an utterance that will appear in the text much later than
    the current utterance.
  notes:
    - >-
      The utterance that this cmavo refers to is text. Using this cmavo alone
      refers to the words and rhetoric of the utterance. In constrast, prefixing
      this cmavo with {la'e} refers to what the text ''means''.
    - >-
      The "much later" part of the definition is defined to be in contrast with
      {de'e}, which refers to a utterance coming soon in the future. In other
      words, this cmavo refers to an utterance that will appear later than the
      utterance referred to by {de'e}.
