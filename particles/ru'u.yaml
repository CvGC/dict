  notes:
    - >-
      Does this work like sruri, which has "near total containment in some
      dimension(s)" in the notes?
    - >-
      The ru'u limna example seems like it doesn't work, because Alice herself
      is not wrapped around anything.
    - Is this word actually ''useful'' for much of anything.
    - >-
      For usages like ru'u limna to be retained, ru'u should mean something like
      "spanning around a point". The event of Alice swimming occupies an area
      around a certain point and the event stays within the boundaries of this
      area. (This would make it somewhat similar to vi'u). Another option would
      be to say that ru'u doesn't describe a full circle, but rather an arch of
      any length which is defined by the directional vector of the selbri.
