      Tags a sumti as not fitting the 1st place of nibli. Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra place with the meaning of the 1st place
      of nibli and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other words, the
      event described by the bridi does not logically follow from the referent
      of the tagged sumti.
