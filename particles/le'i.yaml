      It converts a selbri, selecting its first argument, into a sumti. The
      resulting expression refers specifically to the set of individuals that
      the speaker has in mind and describes as fitting the first argument of the
      selbri. An inner quantifier can be used to indicate the cardinality of the
      set.  An outer quantifier can be used to quantify distributively over such
      sets. A fractional outer quantifier can be used to select a subset and
      indicate its cardinality as a fraction of the cardinality of the set.
