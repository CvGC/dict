      da, de, di are '''singular''' variables when bound by singular quantifier,
      i.e. they take values one at a time. The quantifier indicates the number
      of values it can take such that with each of those values the quantified
      bridi is true. A variable bound by a '''plural''' quantifier could take
      more than one value at a time to satisfy a predicate.
