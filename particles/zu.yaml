  word: zu

  definition: >-
    Long time distance. It indicates that the event is separated by a long time
    from the speaker or reference point. When tagging a sumti, the sumti
    specifies the long time separation distance.
  proposed tag:
    - fi'o barda temci be lo manri

    - za
    - zi

      Long ago and far away beneath the skies of blue, We laughed and played and
      dreamed away the hours, me and you.

      Neither CLL nor ma'oste specify the meaning of tagged sumti with ZI, but
      the idea is that they work analogously to VA. VA in CLL tags the reference
      point instead of the distance as proposed here. In the ma'oste, two
      options are given for VA: they either tag the reference point: "a
      short/medium/long distance from...", or they tag the actual position of
      the event, as away from the speaker: "here/there/yonder at...". This last
      possibility is not mentioned in CLL.
