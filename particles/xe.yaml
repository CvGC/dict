  'on fa, fe, fi, fo and fu': []
  in combination with xi:
    - >-
      Tagging one of fa, fe, fi, fo or fu with xi and a number turns the FA into
      "tag the nth sumti place".
  'resume counting, skipping places':
    - >-
      Normally, sumti places start with either 1, or 2 (if the first sumti comes
      after the selbri) and after each sumti, the next place is filled. If the
      number of places of the selbri is reached, all the next places have an
      implicit do'e tag. ''danr: this do'e part is not in the CLL, is it?''
    - 'danr: Where does the apple end up in mi fi do dunda lo plise?'
    - >-
      When a sumti place is already filled (for instance, if a FA was used to
      jump back), that place is 'skipped'
    - fai will not affect the numbering of places around it.
    - >-
      Places continue from where the tag left off (i.e. fu ko'a ko'e - fills x5
      and x6 respectively).
  using a place multiple times:
    - >-
      Assigning two sumti to the same place directly is like connecting the two
      sumti with 'e' and putting the result in that place.
