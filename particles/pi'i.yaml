pi'i:
  word: pi'i
  class: VUhU1
  pos: connective
  definition: >-
    The n-ary operation of multiplication. Multiplies all the arguments together
    in a left associative manner: x1 * x2 * x3 ...
  confer: []
  keywords:
    - multiplication
    - multiply
    - times
  examples:
    li ci su'i vo pi'i mu du li cimu: '3 + 4 Ã— 5 = 35 (CLL, 18.5.8)'
  notes:
    - >-
      When reducing a ''pi'i'' expression from left to right, the types of the
      two operands considered at each point must together take one of the
      following forms:
    - >-
      number and number -- standard mathematical multiplication; evalutes to a
      number
    - >-
      number and matrix ''or'' matrix and number -- scaling the elements of a
      matrix by a factor; evaluates to a matrix
    - >-
      number and array of numbers ''or'' array of numbers and number -- scaling
      the elements of an array by a factor; evaluates to an array of numbers
    - >-
      matrix and matrix -- standard matrix multiplication; the number of columns
      in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the right matrix,
      otherwise the result is undefined; evaluates to a matrix
    - >-
      matrix and array of numbers -- The operator ''sa'i'' is implicitly applied
      to the array, and the expression is then evaluated as a matrix-matrix
      multiplication, yielding a one-column matrix that is then implicitly
      converted to an array of the numbers in its column.
    - 'When ''''pi''i'''' has only one operand, it is the identity function.'
