    A digit representing both the fraction slash, when modifying other digits,
    and the golden ratio, when on its own. When used between two digit strings
    ''m'' and ''n'', it makes the entire number a fraction ''m''/''n''. When
    used in front of a digit string ''m'', it makes the entire number a fraction
    1/''m''. When used after a digit string m, it makes the entire number string
    a fraction ''m''/1. When used on its own, it represents the golden ratio Ï†,
    a mathematical constant equal to half of the sum of one and the square root
    of five, or approximately 1.618033.
