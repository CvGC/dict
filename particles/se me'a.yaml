      Tags a sumti as fitting the 2nd place of mleca.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra, un-numbered place with the meaning of
      the 2nd place of mleca and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other
      words, the event described by the bridi is less than the referent of the
      tagged sumti.
