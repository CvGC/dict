      Tags a sumti as fitting the 3rd place of panra.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra, un-numbered place with the meaning of
      the 3rd place of panra and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other
      words, the event described by the bridi is almost the same as something
      unspecified, with the only differences indicated by the referent of the
      tagged sumti.
