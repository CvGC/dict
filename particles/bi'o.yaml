  pos: connective
  definition: >-
    Non-logical interval connective. Joins two values into an ordered interval
    that reaches from the first value to the second.
  notes:
    - >-
      Order of the connected values very much so does matter.  For (a, b) to be
      good ("positive"), it must be the case that <math>a \leq b</math>.
      Conventionally, one might define -(b, a) = (a, b) for all real numbers a,
      b; in this case (b, a) is considered to be bad ("negative") and requires
      the corrective factor of -1 in the evaluation of the expression.
