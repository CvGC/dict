zi:
  word: zi
  class: ZI
  pos: preposition

    Short time distance. It indicates that the event is separated by a short
    time from the speaker or reference point. When tagging a sumti, the sumti
    specifies the short time separation distance.

      He married late in life and died only five years later, leaving his wife
      with three small children.
  notes:
    - >-
      Neither CLL nor ma'oste specify the meaning of tagged sumti with ZI, but
      the idea is that they work analogously to VA. VA in CLL tags the reference
      point instead of the distance as proposed here. In the ma'oste, two
      options are given for VA: they either tag the reference point: "a
      short/medium/long distance from...", or they tag the actual position of
      the event, as away from the speaker: "here/there/yonder at...". This last
      possibility is not mentioned in CLL.
