      It indicates that the event is located to the left of a certain point.

      of.

  general section issues:
    - >-
      Most of these make no sense in front of a selbri with "mi" in the bridi,
      because you can't be (for example) above yourself, so "mi ga'u zutse"
      doesn't seem possible.
    - >-
      They make perfect sense. The implicitly tagged sumti is understood from
      context. "mi ga'u zutse" expands to "lo nu mi zutse cu gapru (zo'e)". This
      zo'e is usually understood to be the position of the speaker, just like
      the default for "pu" is the time of the speaker. However, here it very
      clearly means "I sit above (something)." --[[selpa'i]]
    - >-
      Does "ri'u do" mean "on your right", or "rightwards of you relative to the
      speaker"? Whichever it means, we need a way to say the other without
      leaving tenses.
    - >-
      I would think ri'u do would be the latter, while do ri'u is the former. -
