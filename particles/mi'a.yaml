      It is currently uncertain whether this word always excludes {do}.
      According to its current official description, the word refers to "me/we
      ... & others unspecified, but not you, the listener," which excludes {do}.
      However, excluding {do} implies that in the case that the speakers and
      addressees of an utterance share some people, {mi'a} excludes those shared
      members, thus becoming different from the combination of the first- and
      third-persons.
