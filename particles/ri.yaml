      Repeats the most recently started complete sumti. When back-counting, most
      pro-sumti are skipped over by {ri}, and can be repeated instead by
      repeating them literally. Pro-sumti whose referents would change if
      repeated literally are available to {ri}, namely {ti}, {ta}, {tu}, {ce'u},
      {ma}, {zo'e} and {zu'i}.
