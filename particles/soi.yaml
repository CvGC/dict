soi:
  class: SOI
  pos: cast from sentence to term
  definition: >-
    This discursive indicates reciprocal relationship between sumti in this
    bridi.
  notes:
    - >-
      It corresponds to vice-versa in English. If followed by two sumti, it
      indicates that those two sumti may be swapped in the bridi and the bridi
      will remain true. If only followed by one sumti, the second sumti is
      inferred the be the sumti immediately before soi. Its ellidible terminator
      is {se'u}.

      Chapter *20*, of all places, in the CLL says that mi prami do soi mi is
      legal, but Chapter 7 doesn't really say that, quite.

      What the hell does this SOI mean?]
    - >-
      There has been discussion about whether soi changes the referral distance
      of vo'V. Not sure if it should go here though
    - >-
      [http://www.lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg20920.html] - Xod: vo'a was
      usually intended as long-distance when alone, and usually short-distance
      when used with soi.

      [http://www.lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg20936.html] - Nick Nicholas:
      So vo'a *may* end in practice being defined as [...] short-distance when
      context favours that reading -- for instance, soi vo'a.

      [http://www.lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg20057.html] - And Rosta
      translates a Lojban sentence in a way that implies that he things vo'a is
      long-distance, regardless of soi.

      [http://www.lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg20880.html] - Nick Nicholas'
      position on vo'a: long-distance by default, can be forced short-distance
      in _syntactic_ contexts, ie. after soi.
    - >-
      There has been some discussion on how long da-series cmavo stay bound, ie.
      whether or not they are always canceled by sentence boundaries not joined
      by connectives. This, however, has no bearing on ''da'o'', which cancels
      unconditionally.
    - 'There is a proposal to change {da''o} documented here.'
    - >-
      There is a proposal by [[selpa'i]] to repurpose {soi} into something more
      useful. See [http://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=New_soi this page] for a
      description of the change.
