ri'o:
  word: ri'o

  pos: connective
  definition: >-
    The trinary operation of taking the definite integral of a function. The
    integral of x1 with respect to x2 over range x3

  examples:
    li ri'o pa xy. no bi'e bi'o pa du li pa: The integral of 1 with respect to x from 0 to 1 is equal to 1

      This definition should be extended somehow to accommodate indefinite
      integration. I suggest that indefinite integration should be the
      interpretation when x3 is omitted. I'm not sure whether the grammar is
      capable of polymorphic operators like this. Other options/ways to get this
      behaviour is to default x3 to ''no bi'o ty'' (recover indefinite integrals
      as parameter integrals), or make it the indefinite when x3 is filled with
      ''mo'e zi'o''.

      This definition is (rather sneakily) fully compatible with a Lebesgue
      definition of integration. Just give a measurable function as x1, a
      measure to x2 and measurable set to x3.
