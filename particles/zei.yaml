      Connects words into a lujvo.  Joins preceding and following words into a
      lujvo.  For grammatical purposes, "zei" binds with the preceding word and
      the following word. The combination is considered a single brivla (i.e. it
      is treated as just one word). In the case of an apparent conflict, the
      effects of this word (and all other words that change the grammatical
      effects of nearby words) should be read left to right.  See also lujvo.
