  proposed defintion:
    - >-
      This flag converts letteral string or other mathematical expression (mex)
      operand into a mex operator. Its elidable terminator is {te'u}.

  notes:
    - >-
      The CLL has the following observation: There is a potential semantic
      ambiguity in ''ma'o fy. ~91~te'u~93~'' if ''fy.'' is already in use as a
      variable: it comes to mean "the function whose value is always 'f' ".
      However, mathematicians do not normally use the same lerfu words or
      strings as both functions and variables, so this case should not arise in
      practice.
