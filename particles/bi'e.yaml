  pos: connective modifier
  definition: >-
    Indicates an operator has precedence over unmarked operators. When an
    operator is prefixed with this cmavo, it becomes automatically of higher
    precedence than other operators not so prefixed. If more than one operator
    has a ''bi'e'' prefix, grouping is to the right; multiple ''bi'e'' prefixes
    on a single operator are not allowed.  
  notes:
    - 'This is distinct from the use of mathematical brackets {vei} and {ve''o}.'
