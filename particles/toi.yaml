      TOI is currently seldom elidable. I believe that currently it is only
      elidable at the end of text. It is the belief of .xorxes., me, and
      possibly others that it should never be elidable. - .aionys.

      TOI is elidible in lots of places. It's rather easy to come up with
      examples such as ''mi klama to zo'o gi'e stali'' or ''mi to mi tatpi cu
      surla''. --[[selpa'i]]
