      which it occurs, adding an extra place with the meaning of the 1st place
      of vanbi and then fills it with the tagged sumti. In other words, the
      event described by the bridi occurs under the conditions described by the
      tagged sumti.  See also: vanbi, se va'o.

      Unless {vanbi}'s definition is especially bad, it doesn't seem to be
      {vanbi}'s modal. It could be that of {tcini} or {banzu} or some other
      predicate depending on the intended meaning.
