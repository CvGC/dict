    used as a normal selbri, with the first place being the result of applying
    the operator to the other places.

      It's been pointed out by Xorxes that {me} could be expanded to do this.
      {nu'a} could be moved to ME for backwards compatibility. It has had
      (almost) no usage in the wild (corpora + mailing list) (literally 6
      mentions on IRC). But it does have a nice symmetry with na'u
