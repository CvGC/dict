    The cmavo "na'u" makes a selbri into an operator. In general, the first
    place of the selbri specifies the result of the operator, and the other
    unfilled places specify the operands. Its elidible terminator is {te'u}. It
    is also used to construct questions about operators.

      This comment applies exclusively to CLL example 18.18.1. I'm not sure if
      it therefore belongs here. The CLL example of this seems to be needlessly
      complicated (using the value of pi/2 where the function is undefined).
      I've changed the example here slightly to avoid any disputes about
      validity.

      If C ''subset'' A and C ''subset'' B, then C is called a common subset of
      A and B. (Fundamental Concepts Of Higher Algebra, Translation by Nick
