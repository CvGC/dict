      It converts a selbri, selecting its first argument, into a sumti. The
      resulting expression refers generically to a group or groups of
      individuals that fit the first argument of the selbri and which
      collectively satisfy the predicate for which the sumti is an argument. An
      inner quantifier can be used to indicate the cardinality of the group or
      groups. An outer quantifier can be used to quantify distributively over
      such groups. A fractional outer quantifier can be used to select a
      subgroup and indicate its cardinality as a fraction of the cardinality of
      the group.
