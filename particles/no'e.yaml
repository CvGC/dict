      # [[scope of na|scope of '''na''' here]] I ([[xorxes]]) am sketching an
      argument for restricting the scope of NA to be just over those bridi
      operators that follow it. The traditional interpretation is that it has
      scope over all other bridi operators, including those that precede it in
      the bridi. Also: [[Reduced logical form|Reduced logical form]] #
