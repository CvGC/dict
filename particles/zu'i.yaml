      ''zu'i'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti).  ''zu'i'' represents some value that is typical for the bridi
      place it fills.  It can represent sumti of any complexity, including
      abstractions, relative clauses, relative sumtcita, and combinations
      thereof, but whatever it represents must be typical for the bridi in
      question.  If the bridi relationship does not actually hold for any
      typical thing in the place filled by ''zu'i'', then the presence of
      ''zu'i'' in that place makes the bridi false.  Lojban constructions that
      ''zu'i'' explicitely cannot match include ''no da'', which is equivalent
      to putting ''na'' in front of the selbri of the bridi in question and
      hence alters the meaning completely, ''zi'o'', which utterly changes the
      nature of the bridi to one which has a different place structure, and
      ''ma'', which turns a statement into a question.  None of these can be
      typical place fillers in any case.
