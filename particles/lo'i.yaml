      It converts a selbri, selecting its first argument, into a sumti. The
      resulting expression refers generically to a set or sets of individuals
      that fit the first argument of the selbri. An inner quantifier can be used
      to indicate the cardinality of the set. An outer quantifier can be used to
      quantify distributively over such sets. A fractional outer quantifier can
      be used to select a subset and indicate its cardinality as a fraction of
      the cardinality of the set.
