      Tags have two related but distinct functions, as unary bridi operators and
      as binary bridi operators.
    - 'As unary operators, they can take an argument that specifies the tag.'

      The sense of fi'o ''selbri'' as a bridi operator has to be defined for
      each ''selbri''. In many cases it will correspond to the sentence filling
      the x2 or some other place of ''selbri'', but this only works when
      ''selbri'' will admit a sentence as one of its arguments. A general
      orientative rule might be that the sentence fills the first place (after
      the x1, which is already accounted for) that will admit a sentence. If
      there is no place that will admit a sentence, then the relationship is a
      vague one.

      The negation unary operator, NA/NA KU, can also be expressed as fi'o natfe
      or fi'o natfe lo fatci. For example mi fi'o natfe fe'u klama le zarci
      ''that I go to the market is contradicted by the facts" mi na klama le
      zarci ''I don't go to the market''.
    - >-
      Bridi operators in general are not commutative, so the order in which tags
      appear with respect to negation, quantifiers, connectives or other tags
      matters. The general rule is that a bridi operator has scope over the
      operators that follow and is within the scope of preceding operators.
    - >-
      As binary operators, only some tags are meaningful. For example pu gi ...
      gi ... and ri'a gi ... gi ..., but not bau gi ... gi ... or ka'a gi ... gi
      .... In general, fi'o ''selbri'' will be meaningful as a connective if the
      x1 of ''selbri'' is meaningful with a sentence.
