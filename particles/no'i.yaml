  class: NIhO
  definition: Marks the start of a paragraph and change back to a previous subject.
  notes:
    - >-
      If no'i has a positive or zero subscript, it indicates the continuation of
      an earlier topic that was introduced with the word ni'o with the same
      subscript. If no'i has a negative subscript, it is a resumption of the
      topic of the paragraph found by counting backwards, starting with the
      paragraph before the one introduced with ni'o.
  confer:
    - ni'o
