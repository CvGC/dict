    Converts a number, lerfu-string or ME-converted sumti into a tanru-unit. The
    place structure in the case of a number is ''"x1 are ''[number]'' in number
    and are among x2"''. In general for any sumti the place structure is ''"x1
    is/are among x2, quantified by ''[number/lerfu/sumti]''"''.

      klaku: The definitions for this cmavo are many and contradicting. CLL
      states 3 or four te sumti, this page's definition 2, and valsi/vlasisku
      states 3 te sumti. Also, it is not clear what mei3 is supposed to be. I
      suggest the other definitions be changed to match this one, with only 2 te
      sumti.
