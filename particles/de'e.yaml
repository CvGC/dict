  pos: pronoun
  definition: >-
    A pro-sumti for an utterance that will appear in the text soon, after the
    current utterance.
  notes:
    - >-
      The utterance that this cmavo refers to is text. Using this cmavo alone
      refers to the words and rhetoric of the utterance. In constrast, prefixing
      this cmavo with {la'e} refers to what the text ''means''.
    - >-
      The "soon" part of the definition is defined to be in contrast with
      {da'e}, which refers to a utterance coming very far in the future. In
      other words, this cmavo refers to an utterance that will appear in the
      future but still earlier than the utterance referred to by {da'e}.
