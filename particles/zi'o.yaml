      ''zi'o'' is gramatically a pro-sumti, meaning it fills a sumti place, but
      unlike other pro-sumti ''zi'o'' actually removes the place it fills from
      the bridi it is in entirely.  A bridi with ''zi'o'' in it actually
      represents a completely different relationship, one with one less element
      being related.

        The meaning of -zil-] has had some confusion, and this ties in nicely to
        the current debate as to the meaning of ''ziltau''.
