      Tags a sumti as fitting the 1st place of lidne.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra, un-numbered place with the meaning of
      the 1st place of lidne and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other
      words, the event described by the bridi is associated with something that
      is non-temporally preceded by the referent of the tagged sumti.
