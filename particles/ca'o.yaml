      It indicates that a situation is in progress, ongoing. When tagging a
      sumti, the sumti indicates an event encompassed by the ongoing situation.
      It does not give the duration of the main event (ZEhAs do that), it only
      indicates that the main event completely overlaps another event. ''broda
      ca'o lo nu brode'' ~= ''ca lo nu brode cu ca'o broda''.
