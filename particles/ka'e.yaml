ka'e:
  word: ka'e
  class: CAhA
  pos: preposition
  definition: >-
    Tense marker used to express innate capability for events/conditions/etc. to
    happen -- regardless of those events/conditions/etc. actually taking place
  notes:
    - >-
      Unlike {kakne}, {ka'e} expresses innate, potential capability, which
      doesn't have to be an actual, present capability. The difference is best
      illustrated by an example: birds (except for few species) can fly (lo
      cipni cu ka'e vofli) but among them there are some that cannot do so now
      (ti poi cipni na kakne lo zu'o vofli) due to being crippled, too young,
      confined in small cage, etc.
    - >-
      {ka'e} covers all situations where {pu'i} and {nu'o} are applicable (is
      more general than both of them).
