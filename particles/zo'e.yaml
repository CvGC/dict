      ''zo'e'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti).  It represents an elliptical or unspecified value.  It has some
      value which is irrelevant or obvious in the current context.  All empty
      places in Lojban are implicitely filled with ''zo'e'', making it (by far)
      the most-used word in the language, in a sense.  ''zo'e'' can represent
      just about anything.  The important exceptions are ''no da'', which is
      equivalent to putting ''na'' in front of the selbri of the bridi in
      question and hence alters the meaning completely, ''zi'o'', which utterly
      changes the nature of the bridi to one which has a different place
      structure, and ''ma'', which turns a statement into a question.  ''zo'e''
      can represent a referant of any complexity.  To fully specify the thing
      represented by ''zo'e'' may require very complex Lojban, including
      abstractions, relative clauses, relative sumtcita, and combinations
      thereof.
