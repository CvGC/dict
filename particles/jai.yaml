jai:
  word: jai
  class: JAI
  definition: modal conversion. convert tense/modal (tagged) place to 1st place.
  notes:
    - The original 1st place moves to the jai place.
    - >-
      By not putting a modal after jai, an abstraction is put into the fai place
      and the x1 spot becomes a sumti "raised" from that abstraction (thus
      letting you put any sumti where the place structure requires an
      abstraction).

      CLL claims that -jax- is a rafsi for jai, but none of the wordlists
      include it.
