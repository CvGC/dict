  definition: >-
    Time distance. It indicates that the event is separated in time from the
    speaker or reference point. When tagging a sumti, the sumti specifies the
    time separation distance.

      Israeli police said they received intelligence about a possible attack an
      hour before the explosion.
  notes:
    - >-
      Proposed definition definition differs from CLL and ma'oste in that
      "medium" has been removed, so that a basic form is available when the size
      of the interval is not particularly significant.
    - >-
      Neither CLL nor ma'oste specify the meaning of tagged sumti with ZI, but
      the idea is that they work analogously to VA. VA in CLL tags the reference
      point instead of the distance as proposed here. In the ma'oste, two
      options are given for VA: they either tag the reference point: "a
      short/medium/long distance from...", or they tag the actual position of
      the event, as away from the speaker: "here/there/yonder at...". This last
      possibility is not mentioned in CLL.
