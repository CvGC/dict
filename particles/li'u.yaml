  definition: >-
    End quotation.  The cmavo "li'u" is the elidable terminator that ends
    grammatical quotations begun by "lu".  Quoted text must be grammatically
    correct Lojban, even if it were to be presented on its own.  It is seldom
    elidable except at end of text.
  notes:
    - >-
      LIhU is currently seldom elidable. I believe that currently it is only
      elidable at the end of text. It is the belief of .xorxes., me, and
      possibly others that it should never be elidable. - .aionys.
