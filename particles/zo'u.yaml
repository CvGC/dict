zo'u:
  word: zo'u
  class: ZOhU
  definition: >-
    Marks the end of a prenex. A prenex can occur at the beginning of the
    sentence, and consists of one or more terms. A term is either a sumti or a
    sumti preceded by a tense or modal tag. The primary use of a prenex is for
    quantifying logical variables prior to their use in the sentence and/or
    sentences that are joined to it by a logical connective. Terms that do not
    quantify logical variables are instead interpreted as 'topics' of the
    containing sentence, and any sentences that are joined to it by a logical
    connective.

    - >-
      Marks the end of a prenex. A prenex can have one or more terms, which may
      constrain the instantiation of logical variables in the main sentence.
      Prenexes are also used as a topic field.

      The wording of the definition of "fa'o" must be watched closely to prevent
      contradictions with [[BPFK Section: Nonce connectives]].

      The selma'o MAI probably requires either preprocessing prior to YACC, or a
      PEG grammar.

      TUhU is currently seldom elidable. I believe that currently it is only
      elidable at the end of text. It is the belief of .xorxes., me, and
      possibly others that it should never be elidable. - .aionys.

      NIhO should *NOT* have different uffects depending on the medium it is in.
      rlpowell agrees. (I don't like how "ni'o"*N resets various things
      depending on N. Can't tense be reset using KI?) -

      It is my belief that this section does not invalidate actual usages that
      were previously valid, nor does it contradict current prescription of the
      language.

      Clarification: topic resumption by label applies if no'i has a positive
      '''or zero''' subscript.

      Clarification: topic resumption by back-counting '''starts at section
      before the one currently being introduced'''.
    - >-
      Clarification: the implication that any term in a prenex is either a bound
      variable or a topic (CLL p. 467) is made explicit.
