  pos: digit
  definition: >-
    Thousands seperator,partitions a decimal number into groups of 3 digits.
    When there are less than 3 digits following a ki'o, replace the ki'o with
    enough {no} to have 3 digits in total. Expansion formulae: Integral part
    (left of the decimal point),"A ki'o B" is A*1000 + B Fractional part (right
    of the decimal point),"pi A ki'o B" ''needs to be defined''

  notes:
    - >-
      Some cultures use a dot as the decimal point, and a comma or a space as
      the thousands seperator. Other cultures use the comma as the decimal
      point, and a dot or a space as the thousands seperator. ki'o is always the
      thousands seperator, and pi is always the decimal point (or the radix
      point in other number bases).

      CLL chapter 18, example 3.10 looks like an error: there are only 3 "pa"
      and 3 "one", yet 4 "1"
    - Needs definition for usage in fractional part
    - Needs definition for more than 3 following PA1s
    - camxes and jbofihe accept "ki'o papapapa"

      kribacr proposes adapting "ki'o" for non-decimal bases, with integral
      formula "ve'o A ki'o B vei ju'u C" = A*C^3 + B
