  class: BAhE
  definition: Nonce word follows.
  notes:
    - >-
      Forethought nonce-word indicator. Indicates that the next word is a nonce
      creation or is nonstandard in some way. For grammatical purposes, "za'e"
      marks the following word but does not change its nature. (The construct
      behaves just as the marked word by itself, though a marked brivla may have
      an unpredictable place structure.) Multiple BAhE cmavo may be used in
      succession, and they combine to mark the next non-BAhE word. See also
      [[Magic Words]].
