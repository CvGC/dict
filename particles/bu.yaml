bu:
  class: BU
  definition: >-
    Combines with the previous word to make a Lojban letteral, provided that it
    is not one of the quote cmavo (ZO, ZOI, LOhU) or one of the erasure cmavo
    (SI, SA, SU), ZEI, or FAhO.
  notes:
    - >-
      If the aforementioned previous word is already a letteral, the resulting
      letteral will not necessarily be the same, for instance, "ky. bu" is
      different from "ky". In addition to single words, bu can be combined with
      a letteral that is already a composite of a word+bu, a zei-lujvo, a
      zo-quoted word, a lo'u-quoted string of words or a zoi-quoted foreign
      text. If there is no previous word, "bu" is in error; this entails that
      "bu bu" by itself is also ungrammatical.
