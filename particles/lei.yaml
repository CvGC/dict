      It converts a selbri, selecting its first argument, into a sumti. The
      resulting expression refers specifically to a group of individuals that
      the speaker has in mind and describes as fitting the first argument of the
      selbri and which collectively satisfy the predicate for which the sumti is
      an argument. An inner quantifier can be used to indicate the cardinality
      of the group. An outer quantifier can be used to quantify distributively
      over such groups. A fractional outer quantifier can be used to select a
      subgroup and indicate its cardinality as a fraction of the cardinality of
      the group.
