ko:
  word: ko
  class: KOhA3
  pos: pronoun
  definition: >-
    An ''imperative'' pro-sumti for "you," the person or people that the speaker
    is addressing. Similar to "do", except that the sentence it is in becomes
    imperative in the sense, "Make this sentence true."
  notes:
    - >-
      Like {do}, this cmavo can be used multiple times in a sentence, anywhere
      where a {sumti} is valid. It changes the sentence from a statement into a
      request in the sense of somehow making the sentence true. For instance,
      "la .djan. klama ko" closely means, "Make it so that 'John comes to you'
      is true," or, "Make John come to you."
