be:
  class: BE
  definition: >-
      Part of the Linkarg construction { BE term (BEI term) (BEI term) ...
      (BEhO) }, which is attached immediately after a selbri or a tanru-unit,
      and is part thereof. {be} introduces the first term (= sumti or tag-term
      or NAKU) to be attached to the preceding selbri or tanru-unit. If more
      terms are to be linked to the same selbri target, {bei} must be used
      instead of {be}. The whole Linkarg construction can be explicitely ended
      with {be'o}. If no FA or other tag precedes the first linked sumti of the
      Linkarg construction, this first sumti occupies by default the x2 of the
      target selbri. Similarly to the convention for the main bridi, any linked
      sumti not tagged with a FA tag will fill the next available argument slot.
      The Linkarg construction is primarily used to link sumti into parts of
      tanru, or to link sumti into a selbri which is part of a description
      sumti.
