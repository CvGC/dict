      I don't think this needs a separate definition. Under the regularized
      meaning of {nai} with tenses, the meaning is self-explanatory. It should
      be listed under NAI, not under TAhE.

      The question has been brought up, "What do these mean as tcita?". Our best
      guess so far has been the time during which the interval takes place. {.i
      broda ta'e lo brode} is {.i ta'e broda ca lo brode} (best I can explain).
      Note, this has actually NOT been covered in CLL. It does not state in
      Chapter 10, nor anywhere else in the book that I've found, that TAhE can
      actually be used as a tcita (it can, says machine grammar) or what it
      means semantically. - lindar
