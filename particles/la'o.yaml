  definition: Non-Lojban name quotation.
  notes:
    - >-
      Creates a delimited non-Lojban name.  The resulting quote sumti is treated
      as a name.  The result is treated as a single word.  The cmavo "la'o" is
      approximately equivalent to "lo se cmene be zoi", when the zoi clause
      quotes a name.  "la'o" uses the following Lojban word as a delimiting word
      and quotes all further text until the same word is repeated.  Both
      delimiter words lose their usual grammatical function, as do any Lojban
      words that might be inside the quote.  For grammatical purposes, "la'o"
      binds with both delimiter words and all the quoted text.  The combination
      is considered a single word of the pseudo selma'o ''any-string'' (this
      word acts as a sumti in all respects) except for SA matching purposes,
      where it retains the selma'o ZOI.  In the case of an apparent conflict,
      the effects of this word (and all other words that change the grammatical
      effects of nearby words) should be read left to right.
