      Tags a sumti as fitting the 3rd place of klani.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra, un-numbered place with the meaning of
      the 3rd place of klani and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other
      words, the event described by the bridi is measured on a scale which is
      the referent of the tagged sumti.
