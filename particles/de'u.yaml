  definition: >-
    A pro-sumti for an utterance that appeared in the text recently, before the
    current utterance.
  notes:
    - >-
      The utterance that this cmavo refers to is text. Using this cmavo alone
      refers to the words and rhetoric of the utterance. In constrast, prefixing
      this cmavo with {la'e} refers to what the text ''means''.
    - >-
      The "recently" part of the definition is defined to be in contrast with
      {da'u}, which refers to a utterance coming very far in the past. In other
      words, this cmavo refers to an utterance that appeared in the past but
      still later than the utterance referred to by {da'u}.
