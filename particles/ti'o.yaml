      The purpose of this is to define a heirarchy of precedence for mex
      operators.  <br> The format of a {ti'o} declaration has not been formally
      established, but presumably would take the form of mentioning a mekso
      operator and then giving it either an absolute numerical precedence on
      some pre-established scale, or else specifying relative precedences
      between new operators and existing operators. Typically only operators of
      selma'o VUhU would be given higher precedence, whereas operators created
      with {na'u}, {ni'e} or {ma'o} would remain at the lowest level of
      precedence.  <br> If such a system was created, there would most likely be
      a predefined set of precedence levels that would match common mathematics
      conventions and which could easily be referenced. In such a system one
      would expect that multiplication would be of higher precedence than
      addition

      This isn't really a definition; more a suggestion of what the intention of
      this cmavo should be. A good system needs to be worked out. I could find
      no mention of it in the mailing list.
