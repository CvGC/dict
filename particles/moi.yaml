      klaku: The moi3 is not very well defined. Is it a process by which to
      order? In that case, describing the process will lead to a very long
      sumti, which is not practical. I suggest that it is a {ka}, so that lo moi
      is ordered such that those with most of the property are before those with
      less of the property. Thus, "second in shortness" is {remoi fi loka
      tordu}, rather than something involving a description of an elobate
      process.
