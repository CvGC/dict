      ''tu'e'' - ''tu'u'' seems to be used mainly to be used to set off a large
      block of text and refer to it metalinguisticially. For instance, there is
      a (very large) mailing list thread called
      [http://www.lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg03769.html loi preti be fi lo
      nincli zo'u tu'e]. Also lots of poetry are prefixed with titles that uses
      ''di'e'' to refer to the body of the poem, set of with ''tu'e''.

      [http://lojban.org/lists/lojban-list/msg08842.html Confusion as to the
      fact that tu'e clauses don't fit into relative clauses]
