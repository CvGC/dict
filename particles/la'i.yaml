    Name set article. It converts a selbri, selecting its first argument, or any
    string of cmevla into a sumti. The resulting expression refers specifically
    to the set of individuals that the speaker has in mind and names with the
    selbri or cmevla. An inner quantifier can be used (in the case of a selbri)
    as part of the name.  An outer quantifier can be used to quantify
    distributively over such sets. A fractional outer quantifier can be used to
    select a subset and indicate its cardinality as a fraction of the
    cardinality of the set.

      An ''individual'' can be anything, including a group, a set, a substance,
      a number, etc. lo broda can refer to one or more individuals. lo'i broda
      can refer only to those individuals that are sets. loi broda can refer
      only to those individuals that are groups ('masses').

      Any term without an explicit outer quantifier is a '''constant''', i.e.
      not a quantified term. This means that it '''refers''' to one or more
      individuals, and changing the order in which the constant term appears
      with respect to a negation or with respect to a quantified term will not
      change the meaning of the sentence. A constant is something that always
      keeps the same referent or referents. For example lo broda always refers
      to brodas. In mu da poi broda zo'u da brode, "da" is a quantified
      variable, bound by the quantifier ''mu'', and it takes its values from the
      set of all things that broda. (Within the scope of the quantifier, it acts
      as a constant term, but it cannot escape as a constant out of that scope.)
      Any term with a quantifier in front takes values from the set of things
      over which the quantifier runs. When an unquantified term is quantified,
      the quantifier runs over the referents of the unquantified term.

      CLL says about default quantifiers: ^''There are rules for each of the 11
      descriptors specifying what the implicit values for the inner and outer
      quantifiers are. They are meant to provide sensible default values when
      context is absent, not necessarily to prescribe hard and fast rules. The
      following table lists the implicit values:'' ^The proposed definitions
      take the view that the most sensible default value when no explicit
      quantification is given is no quantification at all and that the
      unquantified terms are constants.
