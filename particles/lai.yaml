      It converts a selbri, selecting its first argument, or any string of
      cmevla into a sumti. The resulting expression refers specifically to a
      group of individuals that  the speaker has in mind and names with the
      selbri or cmevla and which collectively satisfy the predicate for which
      the sumti is an argument. An inner quantifier can be used (in the case of
      a selbri) as part of the name. An outer quantifier can be used to quantify
      distributively over such groups. A fractional outer quantifier can be used
      to select a subgroup and indicate its cardinality as a fraction of the
      cardinality of the group.
