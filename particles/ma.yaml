  definition: Sumti question.
  notes:

      ''ma'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti). ''ma'' is the sumti question marker, and represents, in many
      cases, any of the English words what, who, where, why, when, and how.
      Specifically, it turns the entire bridi into a question, and requests that
      the listener provide a sumti as an answer.  The sumti response fills the
      place where ''ma'' was in the original bridi and the resulting bridi is
      the answer offered to the question.  To indicate that there is no value
      that could make that bridi true, use ''no da''.  A more extreme rejection
      of the presuppositions or implicatures involved in a question is to reply
      with ''na'i''.  A bridi with more than one ''ma'' can be responded to with
      an unconnected string of sumti.
