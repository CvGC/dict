    - '"coordinating conjunction"?  Is that correct?  What doet that mean?'
    - What about the keywords?

  keywords:
    - >-
      None; there's nothing like this in English except maybe comma. Someone
      suggested:
    - 'coordinating, connective, conjunction, medial'
    - >-
      but but those are mentions, not uses; that is: no-one is going to look up
      "medial" in a dictionary and be happy that they found "gi", since it
      doesn't ''mean'' "medial", or anything like it.
  examples:
    ge nai lo xanto gi nai lo smacu cu xunryblabi: Neither an elephant nor a mouse is pink.
    ganai mi gunka lo valsi gi mi zmanei la rubis.: >-

    mi ge cliva gi .ai xrukla: 'I''m leaving, and I intend to come back.'
