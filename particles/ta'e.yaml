      The sense of "habit" is commonly ignored in usage in favor of a more
      general word indicating that the event is common/normal/ordinary.
      Otherwise it would make little sense to use it for events that don't
      involve an agent. The difference between {ta'e}'s usage and the intended
      meaning of {na'o} is almost undistinguishable as things stand. Current
      usage has {ta'e} as {fi'o jai ze'a fadni} and {na'o} is almost never used.
