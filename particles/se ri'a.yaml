      Tags a sumti as fitting the 2nd place of rinka.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra place with the meaning of the 2nd place
      of rinka and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other words, the
      event described by the bridi is the cause of the referent of the tagged
      sumti.

      Precisely speaking, I need six hours to at least think straight.
      Additionally, I need seven hours to be happy.
      (some meaning is lost as it is six hours that may or may not be consecutive, which isn''t conveyed in the English. Also, does nitcu have sumti raising like that? I thought se nitcu was an abstract.)
    .i do darxi mi seri'a lo za'i mi cortu: 'You hit me, which results in my pain.'
