      # The definition of '''me''' corresponds to the basic relation
      __''Among''__ as formalized in the book ''Plural Predication'' (Oxford
      University Press, 2006) by
      [http://thecollege.syr.edu/profiles/pages/mckay-thomas.html Thomas
      McKay],  which also agrees with the definition as given in CLL. See
      [[gadri: an unofficial commentary from a logical point of view]] for a
      precise discussion on plural quantification and '''me'''. # The
      interpretation proposed for a ME-converted sumti with '''moi''' is an
      extension of the definition for n-moi as n-th.  # The second argument of
      '''mei''' is changed with respect to CLL, to make it more useful and more
      in line with the rest of the system.
