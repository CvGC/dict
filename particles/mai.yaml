mai:
  word: mai
  class: MAI
  pos: cast from digits to free modifier (right)
  definition: >-
    Enumerates a point in the text. Combines with the preceding numeral to make
    a free modifier, which can be placed almost anywhere in a text.
  notes:
    - >-
      MAI is postfix, this was probably decided to make it analogous to mei,
      moi, roi, and re'u. However, this serves to make the grammar of Lojban
      non-LALR(1), because the parser may have to look through an arbitrarily
      large numeral string to decide that it actually belongs in a free
      modifier. This should not be a problem if Robin's PEG parser is made
      official. If Robin's PEG parser is ''not'' made official, however,
      extensive pre-processing will be required.
