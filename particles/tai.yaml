      Tags a sumti as fitting the first place of tamsmi.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra, un-numbered place with the meaning of
      the first place of tamsmi and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In
      other words, the event described by the bridi shares an ideal or idealized
      form of some kind with the referent of the tagged sumti.

      I understood it to mean "similar in shape", which is crazy as a tcita. If
      tarmi extends to meaning "concept" like I could talk about the tarmi of
      ideas or conversations, then this makes sense and should include the
      keyword "conceptually similar to...", which I've added just in case.
