  definition: Joins two sumti into one sumti.
  notes:
    - >-
      The referent of the resulting sumti is the set whose members are the
      referents of both sumti considered jointly. More than two sumti may be
      joined into one sumti by chaining up additional { ce ''SUMTI'' }. Thus, {X
      ce Y ce Z} creates one single set containing X, Y and Z.
