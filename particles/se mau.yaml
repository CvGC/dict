      Tags a sumti as fitting the 2nd place of zmadu.  Augments the bridi in
      which it occurs, adding an extra, un-numbered place with the meaning of
      the 2nd place of zmadu and then fills it with the tagged sumti.  In other
      words, the event described by the bridi is more than the referent of the
      tagged sumti.
