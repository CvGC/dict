      ''ke'a'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti).  ''ke'a'' is only used inside relative clauses, where it indicates
      the place in the relative clause's bridi that the speaker intends have
      apply to the sumti the relative clause is attached to.  ''ke'a'' can
      generally be represented by the English word "it".  In the case of nested
      relative clauses, ''ke'a'' or ''ke'a xi pa'' refers to the inner-most
      sumti to which the relative clause containing it is attached.  ''ke'a xi
      re'' refers to the next outer-most relative clause attached sumti, and so
      on for higher numbers.
