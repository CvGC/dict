  definition: Non-Lojban quotation.
  notes:
    - >-
      Creates a delimited non-Lojban quotation.  The result treated as single
      Lojban word.  "zoi" uses the following Lojban word as a delimiting word
      and quotes all further text until the same word is repeated.  Both
      instances of the delimiter word lose their usual grammatical function, as
      do any Lojban words that might be inside the quote.  The delimiting word
      is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and must not be found in the
      written text or spoken phoneme stream.  For grammatical purposes, "zoi"
      binds with both delimiter words and all the quoted text.  The combination
      is considered a single word of the pseudo selma'o ''any-string'' (this
      word acts as a sumti in all respects) except for SA matching purposes,
      where it retains the selma'o ZOI.  In the case of an apparent conflict,
      the effects of this word (and all other words that change the grammatical
      effects of nearby words) should be read left to right.
