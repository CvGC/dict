      Also x2 fastener, mechanism; code key (= {termifckiku}, {kiktermifra}); x3 is dependent on the type of key, but are those form properties of the key that enable it to serve the function of opening the lock - in the case of a metal key to a padlock, for example, this would be the shaft and teeth.

   notes:
      x2 is the noun phrase/sumti without the article/descriptor; description ((x1 with x2) = gadysu'i); note: 'determiner' has become the accepted general linguistics term, displacing 'article'; however, 'determiner' includes all words that can introduce a noun phrase/sumti, whether a description or not, such as pronoun possessives like lemi, quantifiers (especially in indefinites) like ci and su'o, and demonstratives like ti, ta, and tu; the term 'descriptor' in Lojban, is limited to words that introduce descriptions (excluding indefinites), such as those of selma'o LA and LE, their common compounds such as lemi, and possibly lenu.  'article' typically refers only to a single word; Lojban assumes the broader meaning] See also {valsi}, {cmavo}.

   notes:
      x2 may be a specific object, a commodity, an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posydi'a}, {posyseldi'a} for unambiguous semantics); price is something decided/set by the seller, and is closely akin to offer ({friti}), which is what a buyer may decide; (note that price is not he same as cost/expense, which is the actual amount exchanged in a transaction; the latter is {vecnu} or {canja}; neither is the same as 'value' or {vamji}; in colloquial English, these are sometimes interchanged, at least partially because of the rarity of barter and bargaining in the marketplace).  See also {canja}, {friti}, {janta}, {jdini}, {kargu}, {pleji}, {dapma}, {vamji} for 'value', ve {vecnu} for 'cost', {canja}, {fepni}, {jerna}, {jinga}, {prali}, {rupnu}, {sfasa}, {vamji}.

      x1 expects/looks for the occurence of x2 (event), expected likelihood x3 (0-1, default {li} {so'a} i.e. near 1); x1 subjectively evaluates the likelihood of x2 (event) to be x3.
 

   notes:
      The value of x3 is a subjective estimate of likeliness according to x1, and is the basic determinant of whether kanpe means something like "hope" or "wish" or "expect", although kanpe never carries the connotation of desire; for that connotation see pacna. kanpe with x3 not very close to 1 has no simple equivalent in English, but for objects/states with negligible expectation it is something like "wishing"; if the state is plausibly likely, it is something like "hoping". In both cases, though, the English implication of emotional desire is not present. The value will usually be expressed using inexact numbers ("li piso'u" to "li piro"); not-necessarily desirous wish, not necessarily desirous hope. See also ba'a, djica, pacna, lakne, cunso.

   notes:
      Also: x1 is hopeful of x2; x2 will hopefully occur, as hoped for by x1; the value of x3 is a subjective estimate of likeliness according to x1, and is the basic determinant of whether pacna means 'hope' or 'wish' or 'expect': hoping for objects/states with negligible expectation is 'wishing'; if the state is plausibly likely, it is 'hoping'; when the probability is subjectively near 1, the attitude is described as 'expecting'; the value will usually be expressed using inexact numbers ('{li} {piso'u}' to '{li} {piro}'); wish (= {sotpa'a}), hope (= {sorpa'a}), expect (= {sojypa'a}).

   notes:
      This can cover both meanings of old.  Old in years, i.e. age, can be conveyed through x2 = the world, life, existence (= loi nu {zasti}); in usage this has been a common default for ellipsis.  However slabu is not the opposite of 'young' (= {nalci'o}, {tolci'o}), but the opposite of 'new' (= {tolni'o}); also ancient (= {tcesau}), age (= {nilsau}); x2 is used to x1 (= selsau for reordered places); historic/historical (= {cirsau}, {cirselcedra}; also {vaipru}).  (cf. {clani}, {citno}, {cnino}, se {djuno}; not the opposite of {citno}, {djuno})

   definition:
      x1 is a tile/cake [shape/form] of material x2, shape x3, thickness x4. 

   notes:
      A tile is a 3-dimensional object, relatively uniform and significant in the 3rd dimension, but thin enough that its shape in the the other two dimensions is a significant feature; 'city block' is conceptually a tile; polygon (= taplytai or kardytai - shaped like an approximately-2-dimensional block, lijyclupa - a loop composed of lines).  (cf. bliku, kubli, matci; karda, for which the 3rd dimension is insignificant, bliku, kurfa, matci, plita, tarmi)
