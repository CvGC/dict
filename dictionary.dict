      Forethought emphasis indicator. Indicates that next word is especially
      emphasized or emphatic. For grammatical purposes, "ba'e" marks the
      following word but does not change its nature. (The construct behaves just
      as the marked word by itself.) Multiple BAhE cmavo may be used in
      succession, and they combine to mark the next non-BAhE word. See also
      [[Magic Words]].

      and is part thereof. {be} introduces the first term (= sumti or tag-term
      or NAKU) to be attached to the preceding selbri or tanru-unit. If more
      terms are to be linked to the same selbri target, {bei} must be used
      instead of {be}. The whole Linkarg construction can be explicitely ended
      with {be'o}. If no FA or other tag precedes the first linked sumti of the
      Linkarg construction, this first sumti occupies by default the x2 of the
      target selbri. Similarly to the convention for the main bridi, any linked
      sumti not tagged with a FA tag will fill the next available argument slot.
      The Linkarg construction is primarily used to link sumti into parts of
      tanru, or to link sumti into a selbri which is part of a description
      sumti.

      Tags have two related but distinct functions, as unary bridi operators and
      as binary bridi operators.
    - 'As unary operators, they can take an argument that specifies the tag.'
    - >-
      The sense of fi'o ''selbri'' as a bridi operator has to be defined for
      each ''selbri''. In many cases it will correspond to the sentence filling
      the x2 or some other place of ''selbri'', but this only works when
      ''selbri'' will admit a sentence as one of its arguments. A general
      orientative rule might be that the sentence fills the first place (after
      the x1, which is already accounted for) that will admit a sentence. If
      there is no place that will admit a sentence, then the relationship is a
      vague one.
    - >-
      The negation unary operator, NA/NA KU, can also be expressed as fi'o natfe
      or fi'o natfe lo fatci. For example mi fi'o natfe fe'u klama le zarci
      ''that I go to the market is contradicted by the facts" mi na klama le
      zarci ''I don't go to the market''.
    - >-
      Bridi operators in general are not commutative, so the order in which tags
      appear with respect to negation, quantifiers, connectives or other tags
      matters. The general rule is that a bridi operator has scope over the
      operators that follow and is within the scope of preceding operators.
    - >-
      As binary operators, only some tags are meaningful. For example pu gi ...
      gi ... and ri'a gi ... gi ..., but not bau gi ... gi ... or ka'a gi ... gi
      .... In general, fi'o ''selbri'' will be meaningful as a connective if the
      x1 of ''selbri'' is meaningful with a sentence.

  issues:
    - >-
      It seems quite arbitrary that operators acting in reverse polish notation
      are required to have exactly 2 operands. Especially considering that in
      polish notation, operators are allowed to have as many operands as they
      like. It does not make semantic sense for all operators (for example the
      negation operator, used in the example usage above). Though there is a
      problem in determining which operands belong to which operator, and the
      solution currently is quite elegant for usage, it lacks symmetry with
      forethought equivalent and seems arbitrary.

      joik cannot be immediately followed by another joik, so a sequence "BIhI
      GAhO BIhI" cannot occur, so determining to which BIhI a GAhO belongs does
      not depend on the order in this line.
  general section notes:
    - >-
      BIhI may be used with only one GAhO next to it; this indicates that one
      end of the interval is closed or open, but says nothing about the other
      end. The Taylor series mentioned above diverges at 0, but converges at all
      other points on the boundary of the disk of convergence; thus the outside
      is neither closed nor open.
    - >-
      The definition of GAhO with ''mi'i'' differs from that in CLL, but there
      appears to be no prior usage of GAhO with ''mi'i''.
    - >-
      Allowing BIhI with only one GAhO is a change in the grammar. Since GAhO is
      used only with BIhI, and no [GAhO] BIhI [GAhO] may be followed immediately
      by another [GAhO] BIhI [GAhO], this introduces no new ambiguity.

    to the set of individuals that the speaker has in mind and names with the
    selbri or cmevla. An inner quantifier can be used (in the case of a selbri)
    as part of the name.  An outer quantifier can be used to quantify
    distributively over such sets. A fractional outer quantifier can be used to
    select a subset and indicate its cardinality as a fraction of the
    cardinality of the set.
  notes:
    - >-
      An ''individual'' can be anything, including a group, a set, a substance,
      a number, etc. lo broda can refer to one or more individuals. lo'i broda
      can refer only to those individuals that are sets. loi broda can refer
      only to those individuals that are groups ('masses').
    - >-
      Any term without an explicit outer quantifier is a '''constant''', i.e.
      not a quantified term. This means that it '''refers''' to one or more
      individuals, and changing the order in which the constant term appears
      with respect to a negation or with respect to a quantified term will not
      change the meaning of the sentence. A constant is something that always
      keeps the same referent or referents. For example lo broda always refers
      to brodas. In mu da poi broda zo'u da brode, "da" is a quantified
      variable, bound by the quantifier ''mu'', and it takes its values from the
      set of all things that broda. (Within the scope of the quantifier, it acts
      as a constant term, but it cannot escape as a constant out of that scope.)
      Any term with a quantifier in front takes values from the set of things
      over which the quantifier runs. When an unquantified term is quantified,
      the quantifier runs over the referents of the unquantified term.
    - >-
      CLL says about default quantifiers: ^''There are rules for each of the 11
      descriptors specifying what the implicit values for the inner and outer
      quantifiers are. They are meant to provide sensible default values when
      context is absent, not necessarily to prescribe hard and fast rules. The
      following table lists the implicit values:'' ^The proposed definitions
      take the view that the most sensible default value when no explicit
      quantification is given is no quantification at all and that the
      unquantified terms are constants.

      Creates a delimited non-Lojban name.  The resulting quote sumti is treated

      approximately equivalent to "lo se cmene be zoi", when the zoi clause
      quotes a name.  "la'o" uses the following Lojban word as a delimiting word
      and quotes all further text until the same word is repeated.  Both
      delimiter words lose their usual grammatical function, as do any Lojban
      words that might be inside the quote.  For grammatical purposes, "la'o"
      binds with both delimiter words and all the quoted text.  The combination
      is considered a single word of the pseudo selma'o ''any-string'' (this
      word acts as a sumti in all respects) except for SA matching purposes,
      where it retains the selma'o ZOI.  In the case of an apparent conflict,

      Starts a questionable or out of context quotation.  Text must be Lojban
      words, but needn't be grammatical.  The terminator for "lo'u" is "le'u";
      it is never elidable.  All Lojban words inside a lo'u...le'u quote lose
      their usual grammatical function.  Sometimes, "lo'u" quoting is used when
      the text is grammatical, either because the user wishes just to quote the
      words by themselves, out of context, or so the user doesn't have to think
      about whether the utterance might be grammatical or not.  For grammatical
      purposes, "lo'u" converts all following Lojban words up to and including
      the nearest "le'u" to the right into a single word of the pseudo selma'o
      ''any-string''; this word acts as a sumti in all respects. The selma'o of
      "lo'u" and "le'u" are retained for "sa" matching purposes, however. In
      other words, "sa lo'u" destroys everything since the beginning of the last
      lo'u...le'u quote, replacing it with a new lo'u, and "sa le'u" destroys
      everything since the end of the last lo'u...le'u quote, replacing the
      terminating "le'u" with a new "le'u" (i.e. not changing the quote at all).
      lo'u...le'u quotes cannot be re-opened; to attach more information to a
      closed quote, use "joi" followed by another lo'u...le'u quote. To quote a
      lo'u...le'u quote including the le'u, use zoi.  In the case of an apparent
      conflict, the effects of this word (and all other words that change the
      grammatical effects of nearby words) should be read left to right.

  class: KOhA7
  pos: pronoun
  definition: Sumti question.
  notes:
    - >-
      ''ma'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti). ''ma'' is the sumti question marker, and represents, in many
      cases, any of the English words what, who, where, why, when, and how.
      Specifically, it turns the entire bridi into a question, and requests that
      the listener provide a sumti as an answer.  The sumti response fills the
      place where ''ma'' was in the original bridi and the resulting bridi is
      the answer offered to the question.  To indicate that there is no value
      that could make that bridi true, use ''no da''.  A more extreme rejection
      of the presuppositions or implicatures involved in a question is to reply
      with ''na'i''.  A bridi with more than one ''ma'' can be responded to with
      an unconnected string of sumti.

      MAI is postfix, this was probably decided to make it analogous to mei,
      moi, roi, and re'u. However, this serves to make the grammar of Lojban
      non-LALR(1), because the parser may have to look through an arbitrarily
      large numeral string to decide that it actually belongs in a free
      modifier. This should not be a problem if Robin's PEG parser is made
      official. If Robin's PEG parser is ''not'' made official, however,
      extensive pre-processing will be required.

      It is currently uncertain whether this word always excludes {do}.
      According to its current official description, the word refers to "me/we
      ... & others unspecified, but not you, the listener," which excludes {do}.
      However, excluding {do} implies that in the case that the speakers and

      This definition should be extended somehow to accommodate indefinite

      as parameter integrals), or make it the indefinite when x3 is filled with

      This definition is (rather sneakily) fully compatible with a Lebesgue

    - Is this word actually ''useful'' for much of anything.
    - >-
      For usages like ru'u limna to be retained, ru'u should mean something like
      "spanning around a point". The event of Alice swimming occupies an area
      around a certain point and the event stays within the boundaries of this
      area. (This would make it somewhat similar to vi'u). Another option would
      be to say that ru'u doesn't describe a full circle, but rather an arch of
      any length which is defined by the directional vector of the selbri.

      The sense of "habit" is commonly ignored in usage in favor of a more
      general word indicating that the event is common/normal/ordinary.
      Otherwise it would make little sense to use it for events that don't
      involve an agent. The difference between {ta'e}'s usage and the intended
      meaning of {na'o} is almost undistinguishable as things stand. Current

      I don't think this needs a separate definition. Under the regularized

      The question has been brought up, "What do these mean as tcita?". Our best
      guess so far has been the time during which the interval takes place. {.i

      Note, this has actually NOT been covered in CLL. It does not state in
      Chapter 10, nor anywhere else in the book that I've found, that TAhE can
      actually be used as a tcita (it can, says machine grammar) or what it

      The purpose of this is to define a heirarchy of precedence for mex

      operator and then giving it either an absolute numerical precedence on
      some pre-established scale, or else specifying relative precedences
      between new operators and existing operators. Typically only operators of
      selma'o VUhU would be given higher precedence, whereas operators created
      with {na'u}, {ni'e} or {ma'o} would remain at the lowest level of
      precedence.  <br> If such a system was created, there would most likely be
      a predefined set of precedence levels that would match common mathematics

      Some of the names of the aspects are changed with respect to CLL, in an
      attempt to get closer to a more standard terminology:
    - >-
      inchoative -> prospective (As far as I can tell, other than in Lojban
      "inchoative" seems to describe co'a rather than pu'o.) 
    - >-
      continuitive -> progressive ("continuitive" seems to be used for an aspect
      that emphasizes continuation after a stage of ongoingness, so perhaps
      closer to za'o.)
    - cessitive -> cessative (Typo in CLL?)
    - achievative -> punctual (I don't know where "achievative" comes from.)
    - >-
      The proposed use of ZAhO's as '''sumti tcita ''' differs from the one
      given in CLL:
    - '  Likewise, we might say:'
    - '  12.8)    mi klama le zarci pu''o le nu mi citka       I go-to the store [inchoative] the event-of I eat'
    - '  which indicates that before my eating begins, I go to the store, whereas '
    - '  12.9)    mi klama le zarci ba''o le nu mi citka       I go-to the store [perfective] the event-of I eat'
    - '  would indicate that I go to the store after I am finished eating. '
    - - >-
        CLL also says: ''The interpretation of ZAhO tcita differs from that of
        FAhA, VA, PU, and ZI tcita, however. The event described in the sumti is
        viewed as a process, and the action of the main bridi occurs at the
        phase of the process which the ZAhO specifies, or at least some part of
        that phase. The action of the main bridi itself is seen as a point
        event, so that there is no issue about which phase of the main bridi is
        intended.'' That, however, is at odds with the usage found for ''co'a''
        and ''co'u'', which follows the usual pattern of all other tags and
        apply to the main selbri.

      ''zo'e'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti).  It represents an elliptical or unspecified value.  It has some
      value which is irrelevant or obvious in the current context.  All empty
      places in Lojban are implicitely filled with ''zo'e'', making it (by far)
      the most-used word in the language, in a sense.  ''zo'e'' can represent
      just about anything.  The important exceptions are ''no da'', which is
      equivalent to putting ''na'' in front of the selbri of the bridi in
      question and hence alters the meaning completely, ''zi'o'', which utterly
      changes the nature of the bridi to one which has a different place
      structure, and ''ma'', which turns a statement into a question.  ''zo'e''
      can represent a referant of any complexity.  To fully specify the thing
      represented by ''zo'e'' may require very complex Lojban, including
      abstractions, relative clauses, relative sumtcita, and combinations
      thereof.

    sentence, and consists of one or more terms. A term is either a sumti or a
    sumti preceded by a tense or modal tag. The primary use of a prenex is for
    quantifying logical variables prior to their use in the sentence and/or
    sentences that are joined to it by a logical connective. Terms that do not
    quantify logical variables are instead interpreted as 'topics' of the
    containing sentence, and any sentences that are joined to it by a logical
    connective.

      do any Lojban words that might be inside the quote.  The delimiting word
      is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and must not be found in the

      Most of these make no sense in front of a selbri with "mi" in the bridi,
      because you can't be (for example) above yourself, so "mi ga'u zutse"
      doesn't seem possible.
    - >-
      They make perfect sense. The implicitly tagged sumti is understood from
      context. "mi ga'u zutse" expands to "lo nu mi zutse cu gapru (zo'e)". This
      zo'e is usually understood to be the position of the speaker, just like
      the default for "pu" is the time of the speaker. However, here it very
      clearly means "I sit above (something)." --[[selpa'i]]

  notes:

      ''zu'i'' is a pro-sumti (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified
      sumti).  ''zu'i'' represents some value that is typical for the bridi
      place it fills.  It can represent sumti of any complexity, including
      abstractions, relative clauses, relative sumtcita, and combinations
      thereof, but whatever it represents must be typical for the bridi in
      question.  If the bridi relationship does not actually hold for any
      typical thing in the place filled by ''zu'i'', then the presence of
      ''zu'i'' in that place makes the bridi false.  Lojban constructions that
      ''zu'i'' explicitely cannot match include ''no da'', which is equivalent
      to putting ''na'' in front of the selbri of the bridi in question and
      hence alters the meaning completely, ''zi'o'', which utterly changes the
      nature of the bridi to one which has a different place structure, and
      ''ma'', which turns a statement into a question.  None of these can be
      typical place fillers in any case.

      options are given for VA: they either tag the reference point: "a
      short/medium/long distance from...", or they tag the actual position of

   notes:
      Explanation x4 is an underlying mechanism/details/purpose/method for x2 (= velcki for reordered places), generally assumed to be non-obvious; metaphorical usage with the various causal relations (i.e. jalge, mukti, krinu, rinka, nibli, zukte) is possible, but the non-obviousness, and the existence of an explainer with a point of view makes this word not a simple expression of cause.

   definition:
      x1 is an article/descriptor labelling description x2 (text) in language x3 with semantics x4. 

   notes:
      x2 is the noun phrase/sumti without the article/descriptor; description ((x1 with x2) = gadysu'i);  'determiner' has become the accepted general linguistics term, displacing 'article'; however, 'determiner' includes all words that can introduce a noun phrase/sumti, whether a description or not, such as pronoun possessives like lemi, quantifiers (especially in indefinites) like ci and su'o, and demonstratives like ti, ta, and tu; the term 'descriptor' in Lojban, is limited to words that introduce descriptions (excluding indefinites), such as those of selma'o LA and LE, their common compounds such as lemi, and possibly lenu.  'article' typically refers only to a single word; Lojban assumes the broader meaning) See also {valsi}, {cmavo}.

   notes:
      x2 may be a specific object, a commodity, an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posydi'a}, {posyseldi'a} for unambiguous semantics); price is something decided/set by the seller, and is closely akin to offer ({friti}), which is what a buyer may decide; (note that price is not he same as cost/expense, which is the actual amount exchanged in a transaction; the latter is {vecnu} or {canja}; neither is the same as 'value' or {vamji}; in colloquial English, these are sometimes interchanged, at least partially because of the rarity of barter and bargaining in the marketplace).  See also {canja}, {friti}, {janta}, {jdini}, {kargu}, {pleji}, {dapma}, {vamji} for 'value', ve {vecnu} for 'cost', {canja}, {fepni}, {jerna}, {jinga}, {prali}, {rupnu}, {sfasa}, {vamji}.

kanpe:
   pos: predicate

   definition:
      x1 expects/looks for the occurence of x2 (event), expected likelihood x3 (0-1, default {li} {so'a} i.e. near 1); x1 subjectively evaluates the likelihood of x2 (event) to be x3.

   notes:
      The value of x3 is a subjective estimate of likeliness according to x1, and is the basic determinant of whether kanpe means something like "hope" or "wish" or "expect", although kanpe never carries the connotation of desire; for that connotation see pacna. kanpe with x3 not very close to 1 has no simple equivalent in English, but for objects/states with negligible expectation it is something like "wishing"; if the state is plausibly likely, it is something like "hoping". In both cases, though, the English implication of emotional desire is not present. The value will usually be expressed using inexact numbers ("li piso'u" to "li piro"); not-necessarily desirous wish, not necessarily desirous hope. See also ba'a, djica, pacna, lakne, cunso.

   definition:
      x1 hopes/wishes for/desires x2 (event), expected likelihood x3 (0-1); x1 hopes that x2 happens. 

   notes:
      x1 is hopeful of x2; x2 will hopefully occur, as hoped for by x1; the value of x3 is a subjective estimate of likeliness according to x1, and is the basic determinant of whether pacna means 'hope' or 'wish' or 'expect'; hoping for objects/states with negligible expectation is 'wishing'; if the state is plausibly likely, it is 'hoping'; when the probability is subjectively near 1, the attitude is described as 'expecting'; the value will usually be expressed using inexact numbers ('{li} {piso'u}' to '{li} {piro}'); wish (= {sotpa'a}), hope (= {sorpa'a}), expect (= {sojypa'a}).

      This can cover both meanings of old.  Old in years, i.e. age, can be conveyed through x2 = the world, life, existence (= loi nu {zasti}); in usage this has been a common default for ellipsis.  However slabu is not the opposite of 'young' (= {nalci'o}, {tolci'o}), but the opposite of 'new' (= {tolni'o}); also ancient (= {tcesau}), age (= {nilsau}); x2 is used to x1 (= selsau for reordered places); historic/historical (= {cirsau}, {cirselcedra}; also {vaipru}).  (cf. {clani}, {citno}, {cnino}, se {djuno}; not the opposite of {citno}, {djuno})

   notes:
