notes:
   Also mobile (= comymu'u, for the non-specific opposite of immobile); after a muvdu, object is alienated from/no longer at origin (unless physically returned there, per litru or slilu); agentive move (= {muvgau}, {muvzu'e}), non-agentive transitive move (= {muvri'a}), self-propelled (= {sezmuvgau}), motion of a part of the object (= {pagmu'u}), having a moving part (= {muvypau}, {muvyselpau}); apparent motion (= {mlumu'u}).  (cf. rinci, klama (which differs in that the means of motion is explicit), litru, cliva, fatri; dunda, benji for agentive movement that does not necessarily imply alienation from origin, preja for similar movement with no agent implied, bevri, vimcu)
