definition:
   x1 reflects Gaelic/Scottish culture/nationality/language in aspect x2. 

notes:
   Irish (= {sicko'o}), Scottish (= {sunko'o}), Celtic (= {dzeko'o}), Welsh (= {nanko'o}), Breton (= {fasko'o}); since Scottish/Gaelic is only the northern branch of the Celtic tribes, many would prefer a fu'ivla for Celtic; nationalism might also demand a separate fu'ivla for Irish.  See also {brito}, {glico}.
