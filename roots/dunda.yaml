definition:
   x1 [donor] gives/donates gift/present x2 to recipient/beneficiary x3 [without payment/exchange]. 

notes:
   Also grants; x3 is a receiver (= terdu'a for reordered places); the Lojban doesn't distinguish between or imply possession transfer or sharing; x2 may be a specific object, a commodity, an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posydu'a}, posyseldu'a for unambiguous {semantics}).  See also {benji}, {muvdu}, {canja}, {pleji}, {vecnu}, {friti}, {sfasa}, {dapma}, {cnemu}, {prali}.
