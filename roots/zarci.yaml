notes:
   Also: mall, marketplace, shopping center, cooperative, bazaar, trading post, mart; the concept is the function of selling/exchanging coupled with a location, and is more oriented to the larger concept of marketplace than the stalls/shops that comprise it, though it does not exclude the latter individual shops (= {zaisle}); x3 may include both owners/proprietors and customers in some markets, but in most contexts refers only to the operators.  See also {vecnu}, {canja}, {dinju}, {banxa}.
