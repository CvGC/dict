pacna:
   definition:
      x1 hopes/wishes for/desires x2 (event), expected likelihood x3 (0-1); x1 hopes that x2 happens. 

   notes:
      Also: x1 is hopeful of x2; x2 will hopefully occur, as hoped for by x1; the value of x3 is a subjective estimate of likeliness according to x1, and is the basic determinant of whether pacna means 'hope' or 'wish' or 'expect': hoping for objects/states with negligible expectation is 'wishing'; if the state is plausibly likely, it is 'hoping'; when the probability is subjectively near 1, the attitude is described as 'expecting'; the value will usually be expressed using inexact numbers ('{li} {piso'u}' to '{li} {piro}'); wish (= {sotpa'a}), hope (= {sorpa'a}), expect (= {sojypa'a}).  See also {djica}.
