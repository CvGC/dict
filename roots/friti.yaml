friti:
   definition:
      x1 offers/proffers x2 [offering] to x3 with conditions x4. 

   notes:
      (x4 may be nu canja, nu pleji, etc.; an unconditional offering has the 'condition' of acceptance); x2 may be a specific object, a commodity, an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posfriti}, posyselfriti for unambiguous {semantics}).  See also {canja}, {dunda}, {rinsa}, {vecnu}, {jdima}, {cnemu}, {pleji}, {vitke}.
