definition:
   x1 is a route/path/way/course/track to x2 from x3 via/defined by points including x4. 

notes:
   A route merely connects origin/destination, but need not be improved in any way; (Points x4 are at least sufficient to constrain the route relevantly).  (cf. {litru}, {naxle}, {tcana}, {dargu}, {klaji}, ve {klama}; {tadji}, {zukte} for means to a goal, {klama}, {pagre})
