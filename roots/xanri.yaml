xanri:
   definition:
      x1 [concept] exists in the imagination of/is imagined by/is imaginary to x2. 

   notes:
      Also x1 is mental (one sense), x1 is unreal (one sense); in spite of the synonym, note that x1 is imaginary does not imply that it doesn't exist in the real world; the definition is crafted so that one can talk about imaginary things without claiming that they thereby don't exist.  See also {fatci}, {senva}, {sucta}, {zasti}, {cfika}, {dacti}, {menli}, {sidbo}.
