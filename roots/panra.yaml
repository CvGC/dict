definition:
   x1 parallels x2 differing only in property x3 (ka; jo'u/fa'u term) by standard/geometry x4. 

notes:
   Also: x1 is parallel to x2, x3 is the only difference between x1 and x2 (= {terpanra} for reordered places); x1 and x2 are alike/similar/congruent.   A parallel involves extreme close similarity/correspondence across the entirety of the things being compared, generally involving multiple properties, with focus placed on one or a small number of differences. See also {pa'a}, {mintu}, {simsa}, {girzu}, {vrici}.
