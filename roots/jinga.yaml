   definition:
      x1 (person/team) wins/gains prize x2 from/over x3 [competitors/losers] in competition x4. 

   notes:
      Also: x1 is a victor; x2 reward; x3 competitors here are opponents of x1 and in many situations, defeated/losers; x2 may be a specific object, a commodity, an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posyji'a}, posyselji'a for unambiguous {semantics}).   See also {cirko}, {jivna}, {talsa}, {cnemu}, {prali}, {pleji}, {sfasa}, {jdima}, {jerna}, {bradi}, {kargu}, {kelci}.
