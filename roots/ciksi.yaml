   definition:
      x1 (person) explains x2 (event/state/property) to x3 with explanation x4 (du'u). 

   notes:
      Explanation x4 is an underlying mechanism/details/purpose/method for x2 (= velcki for reordered places), generally assumed to be non-obvious; metaphorical usage with the various causal relations (i.e. jalge, mukti, krinu, rinka, nibli, zukte) is possible, but the non-obviousness, and the existence of an explainer with a point of view makes this word not a simple expression of cause.  See also {cipra}, {danfu}, {jalge}, {jinvi}, {krinu}, {mukti}, {nabmi}, {preti}, {rinka}, {sidbo}, {zukte}, {tavla}.
