      Also subspecies, order, phylum; (places do not correspond to specific levels in the hierarchy; rather, x1 is at a 'lower' or 'bushier' part of the tree than x2, x2 is 'lower' than x3, etc.; skipping a place thus means that there is one or more known-and-unspecified levels of hierarchy between the two); not limited to Linnean animal/plant taxonomy.
