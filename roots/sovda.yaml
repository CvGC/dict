sovda:
   pos: predicate

   definition:
      x1 is an egg/ovum/sperm/pollen/gamete of/from organism (mother/father) x2. 

   notes:
      (poorly metaphorical only due to gender- and species- being unspecified): ovoid, oblate (= pevyso'aseltai, but better: claboi); egg, specifically female (= {fetso'a}), of a bird (= {cpifetso'a}, {cpiso'a}), of a chicken (= jipcyfetso'a, jipcyso'a. (but note that Lojban does not require specificity, just as English doesn't for either milk or eggs; 'sovda' is fine for most contexts); If fertilized, then tsiju or tarbi.  (cf. ganti, gutra, mamta, patfu, rorci, tsiju, lanbi, tarbi; also djine, konju for shape, tarbi)
