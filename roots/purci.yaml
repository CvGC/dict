purci:
   pos: predicate

   definition:
      x1 is in the past of/earlier than/before x2 in time sequence; x1 is former; x2 is latter. 

   notes:
      Time ordering only (use lidne otherwise); aorist in that x1 may overlap in time with x2 as long as it starts before, x1 starts before x2 but is continuing during x2 (= {cfaprucabna}); non-aorist before, i.e. x1 is over/ended before x2 starts (= {fampru}), x1 is completed before x2 starts (= {mulpru}).  See also {lidne}, {balvi}, {cabna}, {farna}.
