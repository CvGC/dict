definition:
   x1 is a corner/point/at-least-3-dimensional [solid] angle [shape/form] in/on x2, of material x3. 

notes:
   Also apex; a corner exists on three dimensions but need not be limited to points; it suggests a discontinuity in slope in some direction; i.e. in some planar cross-section.  See also {jipno}, {konju}, {bliku}, {fanmo}, {jganu}, {krasi}.
