definition:
   x1 (ni) is the equivalent value/worth of x2 [item(s) of value] to x3 for use/appreciation x4. 

notes:
   Also: x2 is worth x1 to x3; (for x2 person:) x2 merits (one sense); merit reward (= {nemselva'i}); receive merited reward (= {vamselne'u}); x2 may be a specific object, a commodity, an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posyva'i}, {posyselva'i} for unambiguous semantics).  (cf. {jdima}, {jerna}, {vecnu}, {dirba}, {janta}, {kargu}, {pleji}; see note at jdima on cost/price/value distinction, {vajni})
