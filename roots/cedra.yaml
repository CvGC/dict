   definition:
      x1 is an era/epoch/age characterized by x2 (event/property/interval/idea). 

   notes:
      (x2 interval should be the defining boundaries; if merely a characterizing period, the nature of the interval should be expressed in an abstract bridi, or the interval should be marked with tu'a; x2 may also be characteristic object(s) or practices of the era, if marked with tu'a); See also {ranji}, {temci}, {citsi}.
