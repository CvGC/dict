   definition:
      x1 [ideal] is the conceptual shape/form of object/abstraction/manifestation x2 (object/abstract). 

   notes:
      Also pattern; x1 is the mathematical or theoretical ideal form, while x2 is an object/event manifesting that form; e.g. circular/circle-shaped (= {cukseltai}) vs. circle (={cuktai}, while {cukla} alone is ambiguous); model (= {ci'ersaptai}, {saptai}, {ci'ersmitai}, {smitai}).  See alse {nejni}, te {marji} for physical shape, {tapla}, {bliku}, {kubli}, {kurfa}, {cukla}, {mapti}, {morna}, {sarlu}.
