This is a dictionary project by the CvGC.

The first phase will consist of reviewing, editing, adjusting and/or clarifying the definitions, notes, and related data of the Lojban root words, also known as *gismu*. (Subsequent projects may include doing the same for the cmavo.)

How to participate:

* If you want to discuss a particular word, its definition, notes, or other related data:
  1. first do a search for an issue with the name of the word. If the issue already exists, use it for discussion. There will only be one thread (issue) per word.
  2. If no issue exists, create one and start a discussion.

Each word lives in a separate folder under the same name, inside of which there are the following files:
* def.txt (a file containing the definition)
* notes.txt (notes)
* cf.txt (short for "confer"; the "see also" file)
* tags.txt (category tags, like place structure patterns, semantic families, etc)
* ex.txt (example sentences)

The CvGC has the sole power, privilege and responsibility to make changes to any of these files. The CvGC will take into account views, ideas and suggestions that appear in discussions (see above), and is free to act at its own discretion.

The CvGC aspires to bring the quality of the definitions and the related data fields to a high and publishable level.

Note that you can use the templatic https://github.com/CvGC/dict/blob/master/____insert_word_here_____/def.txt to create look-up bots or websites.
