x3 also answer/reply.  If x2 is a person/object, it will usually require 'tu'a' indicating that the reply/response is to that person/object doing something.  'tu'a' may not be needed if the person/object itself is the stimulus, rather than something it is doing. See also {cusku}, {preti}, {nabmi}, {danfu}, {frati}, {cpedu}.
